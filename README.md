# Overview

A repository containing files reproducing dVRK labels for Set Up Joints(SUJ). This is a variation of original one from dVRK official website [link](https://github.com/jhu-dvrk/sawIntuitiveResearchKit/wiki/Full-da-Vinci#setup-joints). The repository contains following improvement compared to the previous one:

- Denser ticks for rulers with the accuarcy up to 1 degree.
- One-side ticks instead of dual-side ones. This avoids the confusion when installing.


# Generate and Install the labels

- Download the [pdf](https://github.com/CUHK-BRME/dvrk_suj_rulers/blob/master/dvrkRulers.pdf) and print it with A3 letter.  
(You need to print with "Actual Size" option and furtherly validate it by measuring the length of print ruler)

- Put double-side tape on the back of entire printed paper.

- Cut each of rulers with scissors.

- Paste the rulers to the SUJs. 
(Note that the origin of the printed rulers and handware should be aligned)
